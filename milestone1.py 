#this is going to be the final function of the quiz, which will calculate the person's score

 def run_test(questions):
  score = 0
  for question in questions:
    answer = input(question.prompt)
    if answer == question.answer:
      score += 1
  print("You got " + str(score) + "/" + str(len(questions)) + "questions right")
