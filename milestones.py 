#this is going to be the final function of the quiz, which will calculate the person's score
##it starts at 0, then I did a for loop to add 1 each time they get a question right
###i did a print statement at the end to tell them their score
####by seeing their score, it can give an incentive of possible pride so they complete the quiz, and by seeing how many they got wrong, it can drive home the point of how bad the student debt crisis is

#Notes for Milestone 2 below
##i basically coded everything I needed to actually let the run test function have meaning, such as creating a question, answer, and Class for it all
###I chose the "fish in the sea" question because it should be kind of shocking to see that these things would even be close enough to consider a comparison
###It would be cool to have the quiz tell you how many of each there are. The student debt crisis is about 1.6 trillion, and there are about 3.5 million fish, which is only about 2.2 times greater
####I know I had to create the question.py file, but I'm stuck on how to define "question". Otherwise, everything runs
